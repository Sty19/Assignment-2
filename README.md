# Vectr.
This is our e-commerce website where we seek to sell all the trendy clothes people want to buy. Our company seeks to ensure all materials used in the production of our products are environmentally friendly and ethically sourced. In addition, 10% of all profits generated by us go towards funding and supporting meaningful causes all around the world. Moreover, We match 15% of all our employees salaries into donating towards charities chosen by our employees each and every quarter. Lastly, Employees bondings consist of volunteering and helping out the community around our workplaces, ensuring that we are there for the underpriviledged communities that we are close to.

## Design Process
As a user, I want to be able to be attracted when I first land on the page and also not have to look too hard or scroll too far to see what is the latest trends of clothes. We also took inspiration from other street-wear brands and aimed to make the website very vibrant. We aimed to make our website to be competitive against other street wear brands while keeping our unique identity.
